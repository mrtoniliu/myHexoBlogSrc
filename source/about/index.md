# About Me

Since I want to do more for my Blog, I need a more detailed “About Me” page I guess.

## Who I am
I’m Tony Liu, currently a software engineer in a small IT company. I choose to be a software engineer because I like software engineering, even though I don’t have much educational background on it. I take to course of IC design in Imperial College London for my master degree, after I get an bachelor degree of ECE in University of Nottingham. I mainly use `C/C++` and Linux during my work, although I don’t have confidence to say I’m an expert now.  I have some hardware experiences in college so I’m more like a embedded software engineer. However I still think that the web technologies is quite fancy for me. I’m planning to learn it, especially the Javascript. 

## What is this blog for
This should be a blog for sharing my learning notes, some thoughts on different things, reviews for books and games. I’ve tried a lot of times to setup such a blog but failed every time. Recently, I’m starting to write some different articles such as my setup, my first 3 month working summary, my workflows of GTD and etc. And also some idea about more articles. I believe these should takes some time to finish. After that the blog should truly have something to read, which should give me more confidence to continue maintain this. 

## Contact me 
There are some basic info on my Github page. Please have a check.
